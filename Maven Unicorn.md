# **Analysis of World's Unicorn Companies**

## Landscape of the World's Unicorn Companies as at April 2022. Microsoft Excel was used for the cleaning, exploration and visualization. Click [here](https://davidokenwa.medium.com/thoughts-behind-beautiful-dashboards-9fb8b24d9f6d) for full article.

## **Background and Dataset**
### This dashboard was created in May 2022 as a submission for the Maven Unicorn Challenge. A unicorn company is a privately owned company with a valuation of more than $1B. The dataset was given by Maven Analytics (Click [here](https://maven-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/Unicorn+Companies/Unicorn+Companies.zip) to download it ). It includes a CSV table with 1,074 records, one for each unicorn company in the world as at April 2022.

### I was tasked to use a single-paged dashboard  to illustrate the current landscape of unicorn companies around the world.

## **Project Steps**

### The steps I took to arrive at the final one-page dashboard are outlined below:
### 1. Getting clarifications
### 2. Making a sketch
### 3. Cleaning the data
### 4. Data exploration
### 5. Data visualization
### 6. Key insights
